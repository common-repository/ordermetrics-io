https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWFcGoGgnu4

Are you an eCommerce company selling across multiple sales channels and advertising platforms but
you donâ€™t know what products and ad campaigns are making you the most and least profit?

OrderMetrics helps you discover your highest and lowest profit orders and identifies inefficiencies with discounts, ad campaigns, and shipping methods by bringing 4 critical metrics together under one roof: order data, cost of goods (COGS), advertising spend, and finalized shipping costs.

= Key Features = 
* View profit per order, product, shipping method, advertising campaign, and more
* Manage Cost of Goods data (COGS) - uploaded manually or in bulk via spreadsheet - and transaction fees from multiple payment gateways
* Sync Shipping and fulfilment costs from your shipping software in real time or upload manually
* Drop Shippers - sync product (COGS) and shipping costs from AliExpress using our Chrome Extension
* Sync Facebook Ads and Google Adwords spend in real time to see which campaigns and ad sets are and are not performing after all variable costs are considered.
* Manage Custom Costs such as influencer marketing spend, app/software fees, Payroll, and more! One time and recurring costs supported.

= Accurate Advertising Data =

OrderMetrics pulls in your Facebook Advertising and Google Adwords data in real time to see how your ad spend affects profitability. Using multiple Facebook ad accounts for individual or multiple storefronts? No problem, OrderMetrics handles that.

Additionally, OrderMetrics allows you to filter Facebook Ad and Google Adwords spend by Campaign, Ad Set, and even specific ads. You can use this filter in combination with our product filtering system to see exactly how much profit you are making from product focused Facebook Ad campaigns. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Fj_81wknDZM) for more information. 

= Accurate Product Cost (COGS) Data =

OrderMetrics offers various tools to quickly enter COGS for each product or variant. You can enter this data right into our dashboard, estimate COGS as a % of each product's sale price, or upload cost data by SKU/product name via a spreadsheet.

Do you fulfill orders via AliExpress? If so, we have great news! We offer an integration to automatically pull product and shipping costs from AliExpress, match these costs with your WooCommerce orders, and import them right into OrderMetrics for analysis. This integration also tracks pricing changes from your suppliers. [Watch how our AliExpress integration works.](https://youtu.be/HAjIiGDQqzg)

= Accurate Shipping Data =

_OrderMetrics is the only WooCommerce analytics app_ that reports back your real shipping costs (not estimates or shipping amount charged) and combines them with your cost of goods and order data to analyze profit. Currently we support the following shipping sources for pulling in shipping costs in real time: Shipstation, Shipping Easy, Shippo, Shipwire, and AliExpress.

Use a 3PL fulfillment warehouse or print labels directly from Fedex, UPS, DHL or other shipping providers? No problem, quickly copy and paste shipping costs for thousands of orders at a time using our easy to use tool that acts like a spreadsheet. This tool then automatically matches up each pasted shipping cost to their respective order.

= Accurate Transaction Fees =

OrderMetrics pulls in all of your payment gateways and allows you to edit transaction fees for each one. These fees are then applied to each order to calculate profitability at the most detailed level. [Read why transaction fees are important to consider in your cost analysis.](https://ordermetrics.com/articles/navigating-shopifys-complex-payment-processing-fee-structure)

= Accurate Custom Costs =
Add Custom Costs such as influencer marketing spend, app/software fees, Payroll, and more! One time and recurring costs supported. See how these costs affect your bottom line.
